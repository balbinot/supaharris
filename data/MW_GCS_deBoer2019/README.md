# Globular cluster radial profiles
-------------------------------------------

This folder contains the radial profiles of 81 Harris GCs as sampled from Gaia DR2 in combination with archival profiles (mainly Trager + HST). This work is described in detail in: de Boer,T., Gieles, M. et al., MNRAS,2019,submitted.

Contents
--------
* member_stars: contains files with member stars for each GC, along with basic information from Gaia DR2. Membership probability is included.
* stitched_profiles: contains files with the stitched profile for each GC, along with plots showing hwo the Gaia profile was sticthed to literature data.
* profile_fits: contains a PDF file for each GC, showing the stitched profile along with best-fit solutions of Limepy and SPES models, along with literature King and Wilson fits from McLaughlin & van der Marel (2005).
